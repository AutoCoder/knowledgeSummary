2. why you consider search for an new position?

   the main reason is the business of our department may change, our map engine may be given up by company and use Gaode'S SDK instead.  i think it has negative impact for me. and also i guess eBay has good technical environment, it's help for me to improve my technical level. and according my experience on autodesk and Danaher, American company usually have good life work balance.

我是11年硕士毕业，最开始在外企工作，目前在阿里系的斑马网络，主要参与的是搜索和一部分数据挖掘的工作，我的技术背景，编程语言上，主要是C++, python也用的比较多，前段时间也用过scala写spark。操作系统主要是linux。在斑马负责的搜索模块中，对切词，索引数据压缩编译，查询重写，归并都有具体去实现。数据挖掘的工作，主要是基于公司的车辆轨迹数据，来预测道路上的行驶速度。主要是用到了阿里的ODPS和spark服务处理轨迹数据，然后采用了一个多目标优化的模型是实现预测，这部分用到了tensorflow框架，主要是因为tensorflow框架比较容易自定义目标函数。

对于java，之前也看过类似的书，但是没有写过java的后台。c++会写，比较短的时间，java应该没问题。
